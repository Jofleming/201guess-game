                <h2>Where I am from</h2>
                <p>I currently reside in Seattle, Washington. Have been here in Seattle proper for about 18 years now. I have lived in Washington my whole life apart from 1 year spent in Australia. I was born in Auburn in 1991, lived originally in Federal Way, moved to Renton then Woodinville, and finally settled in North Seattle when I was 12. Have been here ever since and absolutely love it.</p>

                <h2>What I do in my free time</h2>
                <p>I absolutely love getting out and enjoying the pacific northwest, espcially with my two dogs. I love running, hiking, camping, and exercising. Like most people from Seattle I absolutely love coffee. It is by far my favorite thing to drink. If I am unable to get oustide, or am just feeling lazy, I like to relax inside and watch shows or plays games online. That or play with my two wonderful dogs Izaya and Eevee. Izaya is a Siberian Husky, Eevee a mini Australian Sheperd. They are both 5 years old now and are insanely sweet. Izaya is very cuddly and the most loving lap husky ever. Eevee is full of energy, loves absolutely everyone, and will spend every moment of her existence trying to lick your face. Eevee is chaos, but she is cute.</p>
